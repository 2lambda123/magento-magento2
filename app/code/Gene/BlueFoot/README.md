Magento PageBuilder provides an easy to use interface for building content throughout the Magento application. This functionality can be enabled / disabled from the "Content Management" section of the websites settings.

We do not provide backwards compatibility with legacy BlueFoot API's, the module does however ship with migration scripts allowing legacy BlueFoot users to migrate their content to Magento Page Builder.
