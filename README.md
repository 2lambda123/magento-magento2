## TypeScript
This module utilises TypeScript within our adminhtml web directory. This requires an additional build step or watch command to be running during development on this module.

We use a combination of `tsc` from TypeScript and Babel 7.* with the TypeScript env. This enables us to have fast build times for the large TypeScript code base we have.

#### `npx ts:build`
Runs a single build of all TypeScript files within the defined directory. This utilises Babel with the TypeScript present.

#### `npx ts:watch`
Runs a continuous watch of files and builds them as it detects file changes.

#### `npx ts:lint`
Runs TSLint to verify linting of all TypeScript files

#### `npx ts:defs`
Generates TypeScript definitions for the whole module to be published as a types package.

#### `npx ts:errors`
Displays any TypeScript errors currently within the code base. This utilises `tsc` with the no emit flag.

#### `npx ts:errors:watch`
Same as above but watches for file changes.

#### `npx start`
Command used to start development on this module, uses `concurrently` to spawn instances of `npx ts:watch` and `npx ts:errors:watch`.
