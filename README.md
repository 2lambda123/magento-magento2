# PageBuilder EAP

We open access to PageBuilder code for Partners to:
- explore extension points that PageBuilder provides in oder to build integration with native PageBuilder capabilities for 3rd parties (Facebook, Instagram etc)  and their own modules
- try out PageBuilder customization options to grow its functionality beyond native features
- Prepare to migrate clients from Bluefoot 1.0 to PageBuilder

This program is _not design_ to build a website and go live using early code. 

# PageBuilder Package 
We offer 2 options to get the PageBuilder code:
- Composer package - option for installing page builder if you do not plan to do any contribution into PageBuilder code repository 
- GitHub repository - option to install page builder and contribute to the code
