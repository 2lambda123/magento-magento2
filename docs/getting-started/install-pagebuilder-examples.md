# Install Page Builder Examples

You can find the code examples used, and referred to, within this documentation on GitHub in the [pagebuilder-examples repo](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples). This repo contains two types of examples:

- Fully functional modules
- Files for how-to topics

## Fully functional modules

The following custom content type modules are here for you to download and install so you can learn by example:

- **[PageBuilderQuote](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples/tree/master/Example/PageBuilderQuote)**—This module shows you how to use a simple content type to stylize quotations for things like customer testimonials. This is the completed module featured in the [content type tutorial](../create-custom-content-type/overview.md).
- **[PageBuilderGrid](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples/tree/master/Example/PageBuilderGrid)**—This module shows you how to create a content type to rebuild the Magento Luma home page using a grid structure with grid items.
- **[PageBuilderFaq](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples/tree/master/Example/PageBuilderFaq)**—This module shows you how to create a content type for an FAQ page that uses an accordion for the questions and answers.

## Files for how-to topics

The how-to directories in the repo correspond to the how-to topics in this documentation. They provide the files and code changes required by the topic in order to add the given feature to the `PageBuilderQuote` module.

For example, the topic [How to add a custom toolbar](../how-to/how-to-add-custom-toolbar.md), has a corresponding directory within the [pagebuilder-examples repo](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples) called [how-to-add-custom-toolbar](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples/tree/master/how-to-add-custom-toolbar). This directory provides the files with the code changes you need to make in order to add a custom toolbar to the `PageBuilderQuote` module.
