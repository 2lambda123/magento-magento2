# Install Page Builder Examples

You can find the code examples used and referred to within this documentation on GitHub in the [pagebuilder-examples repo](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples).
This repo contains two types of examples:

- Fully functional content type modules
- Files for how-to topics

## Fully functional content type modules

The following custom content type modules are here for you to download and install so you can learn by example:

- **[PageBuilderQuote](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples/tree/master/PageBuilderQuote)** — This is the completed module featured in the [content type tutorial](../create-custom-content-type/overview.md). This module provides an example of a simple content type that provides stylized quotations you can use for things like customer testimonials.
- **[PageBuilderGrid](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples/tree/master/PageBuilderGrid)** — This module shows how you can create a content type to rebuild the Magento Luma home page using a grid structure with grid items.
- **[PageBuilderFaq](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples/tree/master/PageBuilderFaq)** — This module shows how you can create a content type for an FAQ page that uses an accordion for the questions and answers.

## Files for how-to topics

This documentation contains several how-to topics for adding features to your content type. The corresponding how-to directories in the repo provide the code changes required for adding the feature to the PageBuilderQuote module.

For example, the topic [How to add a custom toolbar](../how-to/how-to-add-custom-toolbar.md), has a corresponding directory within the [pagebuilder-examples repo](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples) called [how-to-add-custom-toolbar](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples/tree/master/how-to-add-custom-toolbar). This directory provides the files with the code changes you need to make in order to add a custom toolbar to the PageBuilderQuote module.
