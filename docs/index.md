# What is Page Builder?

Page Builder is a Magento extension for creating content with drag-and-drop controls. 
We call these controls content types, which provide several key features including:

- **Dragging-and-dropping** of UI controls to build a page.
- **Live previews** of how the content will look on the storefront.
- **Form editors** for entering and customizing the content.

For end-users, this means _no coding required_. For you as a developer, it means that most of Page Builder customization is done using content types. There are two ways to customize Page Builder using content types:

- **Extend** existing content types
- **Create** custom content types
